# Mick's Mental Math Class

Test your mental arithmetic against a timer. Random equations show a missing value that needs to be filled in by the user. If the user gets all the equations right they enter the bonus round which totals all of the previous equations. This is a class based version of the original Mental Math Master - linked below.
